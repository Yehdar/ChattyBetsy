# THE BEAST IS COWERING!
Another day of conquering the MERN stack. Like always, the front-end is relatively easy but the back-end... More specifically, creating APIs and testing if the HTTP requests even work is a serious pain. Regardless, I have made large strides in my goal of learning MERN stack. Frankly, learning MERN from scratch is immensely difficult. I do not want to sugar coat the days and weeks invested into learning it mainly because I do not wish to set ridiculous and false expectiatons for myself and the reader (you). It is difficult, but as the README title suggests, the beast is cowering!

## DETAILS
- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React.JS, NodeJS) Full Stack build
- Heroku as host
- Socket.io for real-time comms between user and server
- React.JS' Chakra UI for developing the front-end
- Postman to test APIs
- ExpressJS for the web framework
- MongoDB as database
- NodeJS for server-side scripting
- JWT tokens and Bcrypt algos for user security protocols

## DRAWBACKS
- I still suck a lot at testing APIs (or maybe creating APIs). As such, the application does not run too well...
- Postman's 500 Internal server error is still a huge bug for me that I am struggling immensely to solve

## TAKEAWAYS
- Invest most of your time learning about creating APIs (possibly get in-person help rather than relying on online resources)

## SHOUT-OUTS
I WOULD LOVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS INCREDIBLE PLAYLIST: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKhlp2qtUcSZsGkxAdgnPcHioRr-4guZf by RoadsideCoder FOR INSPIRING AND MENTORING ME TO TAKE ON THIS BEHEMOTH OF A PROJECT.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
